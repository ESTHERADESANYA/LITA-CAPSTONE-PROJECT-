### Data Manipulation
1. Data Cleaning and Analysis on Excel:
   1. Data loading and inspection
   2. Checked for Null values and removed duplicates by highligting and using the remove duplicates features.
   3. Utilized Pivot tables to summarize data, Filter to improve data visualization and enhance insights.
   4. Charts to visualize trends and pattern, Slicer for interactive filtering.
       
2. Data Cleaning and Transformation on PowerBI: 
- Used power query editor to clean and transform data.
- Removed duplicates using remove Duplicates feature.
- Changed data types using the data type feature.
- Checked for data consistency using the column quality, column profile, and column distribution.
- Data visualization: created Power BI dashboard that visualizes key customer segments, cancellations, and subscription trends. I utilized slicers for interactive analysis.
(e.g, charts, cards,tables).
